# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees from Pewlwtt_Hackard per title, and be able to identify employees who will be eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We created a Retirement table that held all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. We then created a query that retrieved the emp_no, first_name, last_name columns from the employees table and then retrieved the title, from_date and to_date columns of the titles table. 

### Results:

There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)
